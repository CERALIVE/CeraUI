```

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies for all projects:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development commands:

#### Run all projects in development:

**Option 1: mprocs (Recommended - Better UI)**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

_Provides a beautiful TUI with separate panes for each process_

**Option 2: Parallel execution**

```bash
pnpm dev:parallel
```

_Traditional parallel execution with mixed output_

#### Run specific project:

```bash
pnpm frontend:dev
# or when you add your second project:
# pnpm [second-app-name]:dev
```

#### Build all projects:

```bash
pnpm build
```

#### Build specific project:

```bash
pnpm frontend:build
```

## üì¶ Distribution & Deployment

CeraUI offers multiple distribution options for different deployment scenarios:

### üèóÔ∏è Multi-Architecture Support

CeraUI supports two target architectures with specific device compatibility:

#### ARM64 (aarch64) - Single Board Computers

- **Orange Pi 5, 5+** (Rockchip RK3588S) - ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED** for CeraUI deployment
- **Radxa Rock 5B, 5B+** (Rockchip RK3588) - ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED** ARM development platform
- **NVIDIA Jetson Orin** - ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED** for high-performance ARM compute
- **Raspberry Pi 4, 5** (Broadcom BCM2711/BCM2712) - ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT RECOMMENDED** - Insufficient power
- **NVIDIA Jetson Nano** - ‚ö†Ô∏è **LIMITED** performance for full CeraUI features
- Other ARM64 SBCs - Performance varies significantly

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Warning**: Architecture compatibility ‚â† adequate performance! CeraUI requires significant processing power for video streaming and transcoding. Raspberry Pi and similar low-power devices may be ARM64 compatible but lack sufficient performance.

#### AMD64 (x86-64) - Mini PCs & Standard Computers

- **Intel N100/N200 Mini PCs** - Ideal for compact, low-power x86 deployments
- **AMD Ryzen Mini PCs** - Higher performance compact systems
- **Desktop/Laptop Computers** - Standard development and testing environments
- **Intel NUC Devices** - Professional compact computer systems
- **Server Hardware** - Traditional x86 server deployments

### Build Distributions

#### 1. CeraUI Frontend for BELABOX

Deploy CeraUI frontend on existing BELABOX devices (keeps existing belaUI backend):

```bash
./scripts/build/build-ceraui-frontend-for-belabox.sh
```

#### 2. CeraUI Full System

Complete system replacement for development devices:

```bash
# Build for ARM64 devices (Orange Pi, Rock 5B, RPi)
BUILD_ARCH=arm64 ./scripts/build/build-ceraui-system.sh

# Build for AMD64 devices (N100 mini PCs, desktop)
BUILD_ARCH=amd64 ./scripts/build/build-ceraui-system.sh

# Auto-detect architecture (default)
./scripts/build/build-ceraui-system.sh
```

#### 3. Debian Package

Professional deployment with package management:

```bash
# Build ARM64 Debian package (for Orange Pi, Rock 5B, RPi)
BUILD_ARCH=arm64 ./scripts/build/build-debian-package.sh

# Build AMD64 Debian package (for N100 mini PCs, desktop)
BUILD_ARCH=amd64 ./scripts/build/build-debian-package.sh

# Auto-detect architecture (default)
./scripts/build/build-debian-package.sh
```

### Manual Builds

GitHub Actions builds distributions manually via workflow dispatch:

- Navigate to Actions ‚Üí "Build Distributions"
- Click "Run workflow"
- Provide version number and optional release notes
- Download artifacts after build completion

**For detailed build pipeline documentation, see:** [`docs/BUILD_PIPELINE.md`](docs/BUILD_PIPELINE.md)

## Adding Your Second Repository

### Option 1: Manual Integration

1. Create a new directory in `apps/` for your second project:

   ```bash
   mkdir apps/[your-project-name]
   ```

2. Copy your second repository files into the new directory

3. Update your second project's `package.json`:
   - Change the name to match the directory name
   - Add a "clean" script if desired

4. Add workspace scripts for your new project in the root `package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "[project-name]:dev": "pnpm --filter [project-name] run dev",
       "[project-name]:build": "pnpm --filter [project-name] run build"
     }
   }
   ```

### Option 2: Git Subtree (Preserves History)

```bash
# Add your second repository as a subtree
git subtree add --prefix=apps/[your-project-name] [your-repo-url] [branch] --squash

# To pull updates from the original repository later:
git subtree pull --prefix=apps/[your-project-name] [your-repo-url] [branch] --squash
```

### Option 3: Git Remote + Manual Merge

```bash
# Add the second repository as a remote
git remote add second-repo [your-repo-url]
git fetch second-repo

# Create a new branch for merging
git checkout -b merge-second-repo
git read-tree --prefix=apps/[your-project-name]/ -u second-repo/[branch]
git commit -m "Add second repository to workspace"
```

## Project-Specific Commands

### Frontend (Svelte App)

```bash
# Development with hot reload
pnpm frontend:dev

# Development accessible from network
cd apps/frontend && pnpm dev:host

# Build for production
pnpm frontend:build

# Preview production build
pnpm frontend:preview
```

## Workspace Management

### Install dependency for specific project:

```bash
pnpm --filter frontend add [package-name]
pnpm --filter [second-app] add [package-name]
```

### Install shared dependency at root:

```bash
pnpm add -w [package-name]
```

### Run commands in all projects:

```bash
pnpm --recursive run [script-name]
```

### Clean everything:

```bash
pnpm clean
```

## mprocs Configuration

The workspace uses mprocs for an enhanced development experience. Configuration is in `mprocs.yaml`:

### mprocs Keyboard Shortcuts:

- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Navigate between processes
- **r**: Restart current process
- **k**: Kill current process
- **c**: Clear current process logs
- **q**: Quit mprocs

### Adding New Apps to mprocs:

When you add a new app, update `mprocs.yaml`:

```yaml
procs:
  frontend:
    cwd: "./apps/frontend"
    cmd: ["pnpm", "dev"]

  your-new-app:
    cwd: "./apps/your-new-app"
    cmd: ["pnpm", "dev"]
    env:
      NODE_ENV: development
```

## Notes

- Each project in `apps/` is independent and can have its own dependencies
- Shared packages can be placed in `packages/` if needed
- All projects share the same Node.js version (22.11.0) via Volta
- Use pnpm for all package management to maintain workspace integrity
- Use `pnpm dev` for the best development experience with mprocs TUI
